# Zhao_CSCI2270_FinalProject

My final project will be a hangman game utilizing the a menu. The user will
receive a random word to solve and will be able to guess different letters in
word. The words/phrases could be put into arrays in order to keep them
organized. There will be other functions as well such as one that displays
something so the user can keep track of their guesses and how many they have 
left.

None.
